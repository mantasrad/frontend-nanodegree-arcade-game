===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).

This is a project for Udacity Front-end Nanodegree cours.

Game logic - player must cross the road and reach the river, while avoiding enemies.

To load the game simply open index.html file in a browser.

Game is played using arrow keys. In case a collision occurs the player is sent back to the starting point.

Due to limited time available no additional features are yet added to this game yet, but there will be more in the future. :)

App.js mechanics are written by Mantas Radzvilavicius.
